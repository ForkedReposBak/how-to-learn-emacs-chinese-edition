== Emacs key names:

.Table 按键
|===
| 按键     | 说明
| C-x      | means Control-x.
| C-x C-s  | means Control-x, then Control-s.
| C-x k    | means Control-x, then k on its own (without Control).
| M-x      | means Alt-x (Alt is called Option on some Mac keyboards).The M stands for “Meta” which is presumably what the Alt key was called in the 70s.
| M-x help | means press Alt-x, then type help, then press return.
| C-M-x    | means Control-Alt-x
| S-x      | means Shift-x
| s-x      | means Command-x (the ⌘ Command key on Mac keyboards).The s stands for “Super”, from the days when keyboards had Meta, Super, and Hyper keys.
| <RET>    | means the Return or Enter key.
| <SPC>    | means the Space bar.
| <DEL>    | means Backspace(not to be confused with the delete-forward key)

=== Frames:
Emacs 称作你的window管理的windows。【Emacs 手册】

=== Windows:
一个 Frame 中的独立视图。【Emacs 手册】

=== Buffers:
你在编辑的文字。一个缓冲区和一个文件的区别是，他们的内容可能是不同的直到你保存你的改变；并且有些缓冲区根本没有对应的文件
（比如 一个 *compilation* 或者 *Help* 缓冲区）。【Emacs 手册】

=== Mode line:
Describes the buffer in the window above the modeline. Hover your mouse over each indicator in the modeline for a description. [Emacs manual]

=== Echo area:
The line at the very bottom of the frame, used to display small informative messages. [Emacs manual]
frame 的最底下的一行，用来显示小的提供信息的消息。

=== Minibuffer:
The echo area when it is prompting for user input. [Emacs manual]
提示用户输入的 echo area。

=== The point, the mark and the region:
The point is where the cursor is. Set the mark with C-<SPC>, move the point, and now the region is the area between point and mark. [Emacs manual]
point 就是光标的位置。使用 C-<SPC> 来设置标记，移动光标，那么 region 就是 point 和 mark 之间。

=== Killing and yanking:
Killing = cutting. Yanking = pasting (sorry vi users!). [Emacs manual]

=== Major mode or Editing mode:
A major mode is a customization of Emacs for editing text of a particular sort (e.g. a particular programming language). A buffer can only have one major mode active at a time. [Emacs manual]

=== Minor mode:
Multiple minor modes can be enabled at once; they add functionality ranging from syntax highlighting to automatic spell-checking to modifying the behavior of common Emacs commands. [Emacs manual]
